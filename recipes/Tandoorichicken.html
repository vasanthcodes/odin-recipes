    <h2>Follow the Steps given below to make your delicious chicken butter masala:</h2>
    <div class="main">
      <ol>
        <li>
          Prepare the Chicken:<br />

          If using bone-in chicken pieces, make a few deep cuts on each piece. This helps the marinade penetrate the chicken better.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Prepare the Marinade:<br />

          In a large bowl, combine the yogurt, lemon juice, vegetable oil (or melted butter), tandoori masala, ground coriander, ground cumin,
          turmeric, red chili powder, paprika, garam masala, ginger-garlic paste, and salt. Mix well until smooth.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Marinate the Chicken:<br />

          Add the chicken pieces to the marinade, ensuring they are well coated. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight for
          the best flavor.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Preheat the Oven:<br />

          Preheat your oven to 400째F (200째C). If you have a convection setting, use it for better results.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Cook the Chicken:<br />

          Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and place a wire rack on top (this allows air to circulate around the chicken and helps it cook
          evenly). Arrange the marinated chicken pieces on the wire rack. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, turning the chicken halfway
          through the cooking time. The chicken should be cooked through and have a nice charred appearance. For extra charring, you can broil the
          chicken for an additional 2-3 minutes at the end, but watch it closely to prevent burning.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Check for Doneness:<br />

          The chicken is done when its internal temperature reaches 165째F (74째C), and the juices run clear.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Serve:<br />

          Garnish with lemon wedges and fresh coriander leaves. Serve hot with naan, roti, or rice, and enjoy with a side of mint chutney or yogurt
          sauce.
        </li>
        <br />
