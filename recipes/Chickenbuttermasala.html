    <h2>Follow the Steps given below to make your delicious chicken butter masala</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Marinate the Chicken:<br />

        In a large bowl, mix the yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala, and salt. Add the chicken pieces and
        coat them well with the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (overnight is best for more flavor).
      </li>
      <br />

      <li>
        Cook the Chicken:<br />

        Heat 1 tablespoon of butter and 1 tablespoon of oil (if using) in a large pan over medium heat. Add the marinated chicken pieces and cook
        until they are browned and cooked through (about 7-10 minutes). Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Prepare the Gravy:<br />

        In the same pan, add 1 tablespoon of butter. Add the finely chopped onions and saut√© until they turn golden brown. Stir in the ginger-garlic
        paste and cook for another 2 minutes until fragrant. Add the tomato puree and cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the oil
        starts to separate from the tomato mixture. Add the red chili powder, turmeric powder, ground cumin, ground coriander, and salt. Mix well and
        cook for another 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Combine Chicken with Gravy:<br />

        Add the cooked chicken pieces to the gravy. Pour in 1/4 cup of water to adjust the consistency of the gravy. Stir and let it simmer for 10
        minutes so that the flavors meld together.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Finish with Cream and Garam Masala:<br />

        Reduce the heat to low and stir in the heavy cream. Add the garam masala and mix well. Simmer for another 2-3 minutes, then taste and adjust
        salt and spices if needed.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Garnish and Serve:<br />

        Garnish with freshly chopped coriander leaves. Serve hot with naan, roti, or rice.
      </li>
